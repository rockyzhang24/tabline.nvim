FEATURES                                                        *tnv-features*
==============================================================================

The main features of the plugin are:

  * three tabline modes: tabs, buffers, |arglist|              |tnv-rendering|
  * clickable and reorderable bufferline
  * rename tabs/buffers
  * optional buffer filtering on the base of the CWD

Also:

  * `nvim-web-devicons` {1} support {2}
  * tab CWD/name can be shown in the right corner of the tabline
  * commands to quickly set/change (tab/window) working directory
  * reopen closed tabs
  * clean up buffers across all tabs and other commands
  * session management

  {1} https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons
  {2} with a font that supports them, for example https://www.nerdfonts.com/




QUICK START                                                  *tnv-quick-start*
==============================================================================

Add to your vimrc (or run in command line):
>
  lua require'tabline.setup'.setup()

to load plugin with default settings. If you want default mappings, also add:
>
  lua require'tabline.setup'.mappings(true)

If you want to customize the settings, execute:
>
  :Tabline config

Consult |tnv-settings| to understand the meaning of the different settings.




TABLINE RENDERING                                              *tnv-rendering*
==============================================================================

The tabline can be rendered in different modes:

  `tabs`     similar to default, but only showing buffer basenames
  `args`     buffers contained in the arglist
  `buffers`  show N (default 10) most recently accessed buffers
  `auto`     `tabs` if there is more than one tab, otherwise `buffers`

Default order is `{ 'auto', 'buffers', 'arglist' }`
                                                               *tnv-filtering*

  Buffer filtering makes sense if local working directories are being used,
  either via |:tcd| or |:lcd|. When enabled, only buffers whose path is within
  the current CWD will be showed in the tabline.





SETTINGS                                                        *tnv-settings*
==============================================================================

Settings can be passed in a table to the `setup()` function when the plugin is
initialized. For the default value, run `:Tabline config`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting               Description~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |main_cmd_name|         the ex command name
  |modes|                 see below
  |filtering|             enables bufferline filtering based on CWD
  |cwd_badge|             displays CWD in the right corner
  |mode_badge|            see below
  |tabs_badge|            see below
  |label_style|           see below
  |show_full_path|        shortened full path, for example `~/.l/s/n/s/file.ext`
  |clickable_bufline|     LMB selects, RMB puts last, S-RMB deletes buffer
  |max_recent|            number of buffers that can be rendered (most recent)
  |scratch_label|         label for scratch buffers
  |unnamed_label|         label for unnamed regular buffers
  |mapleader|             used in the mappings below
  |default_mappings|      apply default mappings before any mapping you set
  |cd_mappings|           enable normal mode mappings that start with `cd`
  |theme|                 if nil, no theme will be loaded, then use your highlight
  |ascii_only|            avoid any kind of non-ascii character
  |show_icons|            icons from nvim-web-devincons
  |colored_icons|         will use normal bg if false
  |separators|            for active and inactive tabs/buffers


  |mode|         'auto', 'tabs', 'buffers', 'args', in any order
               `auto` will automatically switch to tabs mode if there is more
               than one tab, or to `buffers` mode when there is only one tab
               `args` shows the arglist, but will be skipped if this is empty

  |mode_badge|   for example: `{ buffers = 'B', args = 'A', auto = '' }`
               If `nil` or `false`, the badge is not shown.
               If `true`, default names are used.
               If it's a table, and value is nil or an empty string it won't be
               showed. `auto` shows the actual mode instead of itself, unless
               you define it in this table.

  |tabs_badge|   Displays current tab number. Set to false (not nil) to disable.
               `visibility` is a list of modes that show it.
               `fraction` is the badge style
               `left` is the position in the tabline

  |label_style|  'sep', 'order' or 'bufnr'
               `order` will show the position in the bufferline, `bufnr` will
               show the actual buffer number, `sep` a simple colored separator
               (with a different color in tabs and buffers mode).




MAIN COMMAND                                                     *tnv-command*
==============================================================================

There is a single command, that accepts a series of subcommands, possibly with
extra arguments. Default name for the command is `:Tabline`, but it can be
changed in the settings.

Some subcommands can be <bang>ed, to toggle setting, for example:
>
  :Tabline filtering!
  :Tabline pin!
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Subcommand    Arguments      Description~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  mode          next, {mode}   change tabline mode
  next          {count}        select next tab/buffer
  prev          {count}        select previous tab/buffer
  away                         move current buffer to the last position

  tabname       {name}         ,,      ,,             tab
  buficon       {icon}         give an icon to current buffer
  tabicon       {icon}         ,,      ,,             tab
  bufreset                     remove buffer customizations (name, icon)
  tabreset                     ,,     tab    ,,
  resetall                     reset all customizations
  cleanup                      delete buffers unrelated to any of the CWDs
  minimize                     delete buffers without a window in any tabpage
  purge         !              delete/wipe(!) non-regular buffers in tabpage
  buffers                      |fzf| choose among valid buffers
  closedtabs                   |fzf| choose closed tab to reopen
  session       load, ...      |fzf| load session, or save/create new session
  config                       open buffer with sample configuration


Note: |fzf| means that it needs fzf (the main plugin, not fzf.vim).



MAPPINGS                                                        *tnv-mappings*
==============================================================================

To enable default mappings, set the relative option in the settings.
Otherwise define a mappings table (get it from `:Tabline config`), then in
your vimrc:
>
  local mappings = { your mappings }
  lua require'tabline.setup'.mappings(mappings)

You can also define them by mapping directly `:Tabline` with the appropriate
subcommand and arguments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      *tnv-cd*
There is also a set of mappings to quickly change the CWD, that start with
`cd`. These can be also be enabled with a setting, but are not customizable.

The default directory is either a git repository or the directory of the
current file. In the command line, use <C-j> to change type (`cd`, `tcd`, `lcd`).

Mapping~
   cdw     set the global working directory
   cdl     set a window-local working directory
   cdt     set a tab-local working directory
   cdc     |:cd| to `[count]` parent directory of current buffer
   cd?     show cwd (global/local/tab), git dir, tags

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                    *tnv-plug*
Finally there is a <Plug> available, to select a buffer in the bufferline.
This only works in 'buffers' or 'args' mode. In 'tabs' mode use |gt|.

You have to map the <Plug> yourself. For example:
>
  " press key, then type a character to go to corresponding buffer
  " it also accepts a count, then selects directly the buffer
  nmap gb <Plug>(TabSelect)

  " select a buffer by with count, or execute another command
  nmap <expr> gb v:count ? "\<Plug>(TabSelect)" : ":Buffers\r"

The first form may be better if you use a style with separators, instead of
numbers.
